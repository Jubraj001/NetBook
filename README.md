# About
NetBook is a modern web application built using the MERN stack, providing users with a convenient platform to store and manage their notes. With NetBook, users can easily register and login using JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication, ensuring the security of their information.

Once logged in, users have the ability to create, edit, and delete notes, which are stored in a MongoDB database. This provides a flexible and scalable solution for users to keep track of their important information and to manage it in real-time.

The MongoDB database is seamlessly integrated into the project, providing efficient storage for user information and notes. This allows for easy retrieval of data and potential future development opportunities.

NetBook is designed to offer a simple and user-friendly experience, while also prioritizing the security of its users' information. With its powerful combination of the MERN stack and JWT authentication, NetBook is the ideal solution for anyone in need of a reliable and secure platform to store and manage their notes.
